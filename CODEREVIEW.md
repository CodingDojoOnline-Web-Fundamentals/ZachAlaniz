Hey Zack! We (Jonathan, Michael and I) were super blown away by your pacman.
The code is so easy to read, variables are well-named and declared in the right place,
and the functions break up the logic and the repeated code really well.

And the sounds and ghost choice is awesome.

I honestly tried to nitpick this but it's really well done.
You're doing great so keep it up!
